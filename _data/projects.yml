      *Advisors: Prof. Greg Ganger and Prof. Rashmi Vinayak*
  details: |
      - Collaborated with a team of 6 to implement the disk group concept on the
        top of HDFS, which extended the storage heterogeneity functionality of
        native HDFS
      - Integrated Ganglia system to monitor the cluster under different disk IO
        metrics
      - Benchmarked the performance using DFS-Perf framework to demonstrate the
        stability of our design
      - Improved the flexibility and storage-efficiency of HDFS in the
        heterogeneous storage cluster

- title: Human Motion Video Enhancement with Visual Effects
  meta: HKUST | Jun 2017 - Jun 2018
  advisor_meta: |
      *Advisors: Prof. Chiew-Lan Tai and Prof. Hongbo Fu*
  details: |
      - Built an automatic system to superimpose visual effects into videos by
        template-matching approach, which reduced the editing workload of users
      - Implemented STIP detector and HOG3D descriptor using C++ and OpenCV for
        feature extraction
      - Developed dynamic time warping algorithm to match two sequences of
        video motion features

- title: Video-Driven Facial Expression Animation
  meta: HKUST | Apr 2016 - Jun 2017
  advisor_meta: |
      *Advisors: Prof. Chiew-Lan Tai and Prof. Hongbo Fu*
  details: |
      - Reconstructed a 3D facial expression model from multi-view marked facial
        images by BFGS optimization
      - Extracted the blendshape weights from the 2D facial video by cascaded
        regression method
      - Built a 3D facial expression animation system by data-driven approach
      - Improved the 3D facial expression animation system into real-time by
        OpenMP parallelization

- title: Quantum Information from Two n-Dimensional Pure Quantum States
  meta: Tsinghua | Oct 2014 - Jun 2015
  advisor_meta: |
      *Advisor: Prof. Giulio Chiribella*
  details: |
      Proposed two definitions of anti-parallel spins in *n*-dimensional Quantum
      Space and explored the optimal fidelities of *n*-dimension parallel and
      anti-parallel spins

- title: Robust Influence Maximization
  meta: MSRA | Jul 2014 - Jun 2015
  advisor_meta: |
      *Advisor: Prof. Wei Chen*
  details: |
      - Explored the impact of the parameter estimation uncertainty during the influence
        propagation task
      - Designed a greedy algorithm to find an approximate optimal solution with
        a guaranteed bound
      - Conducted two numerical experiments on Flixster and NetHEPT datasets to evaluate our
        methods
